Ectofuntus
==========

Request URL: http://www.powerbot.org/community/topic/1229458-osrs-ectofungus/



Requires:

1) Completion of Ghosts Ahoy

2) Ectophial

3) 9 buckets

4) 9 pots

5) lots of bones (script does not stop when you run out of bones. It also glitches when you withdraw less than 9.)

6) Ghostspeak amulet equipped.



Optional: 

If you have 58+ agility, shortcut will be used to get to the Pool of Slime. (Has not been tested as I don't have an account with a sufficiently high agility level.


Notes:

- This script currently only works with regular "Bones".
- I have tested with 600 bones. Some minor glitches occurred every now and then but it runs pretty smoothly. 
- I cannot test the use of the shortcut, someone please PM me on powerbot.org and let me know if it works.
- I would advice you monitor as the script runs. My script does not handle randoms nor will it ever. However, I made the script sufficiently modular that you should be able to pause and deal with the random. If you receive an item from the random, it will be automatically deposited in the bank. 
- If for some reason, the script fails to retrieve ground bones from the bin, the script will be stuck in an endless loop. The alternative was if bones are accidentally buried, terminate the script. I choose this option because it is my belief that powerbot will accidentally click "Bury Bones" more often than the bin will fail to be emptied. If bones are buried, the script will be able to recover. In the future I will work on trying to find a workaround (possibly using the chat). 
- Theoretically, you can start from anywhere in RS2007 as long as you have a full ectophial. If you have an empty ectophial and you are at the ectofuntus, the script will NOT automatically fill it up (it only does so if the script emptied the ectophial. 
- Note that you may need to pause the script and put in your bank pin if you have one. After you've done this, close the bank and resume the script.
- Script will terminate if it fails to retrieve Ecto-tokens.
- Script does handle running to reduce time/run.
- Right now you can buy regular bones for 150gp and sell bolt racks for 100gp. This means you only lose 50gp per bone. (Nov 30th.)
- Currently, there is no UI. This will be the main feature added in v1.03.


Version Info:

v1.02
 A lot of changes have been made here. 
- The previous tasks were broken down quite a bit to allow the script to autocorrect more easily. 
- Areas have also been incorporated in this version. 
- Exhaustive testing (600 bones)has been done to ensure that the script works well. 
- Antiban reaction buffers have been added to each task. (Script will wait a random short period of time before continuing).



v1.01
 - Basic functions work
