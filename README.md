Requires:

1) Completion of Ghosts Ahoy

2) Ectophial

3) 9 buckets

4) 9 pots

5) lots of bones (script does not stop when you run out of bones. It also glitches when you withdraw less than 9.)

6) Ghostspeak amulet



Optional: 

If you have 58+ agility, shortcut will be used to get to the Pool of Slime. (Has not been tested as I don't have an account with a sufficiently high agility level.
